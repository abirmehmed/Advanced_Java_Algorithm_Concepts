# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. This approach effectively reduces the time complexity of the problem by avoiding redundant computations.
 
In dynamic programming, the key idea is to store the solutions to previously solved subproblems in a table or memoization array. These solutions can then be reused to solve larger subproblems, leading to an overall optimized solution. The process involves defining the problem's recursive structure, identifying and solving the base cases, and finally constructing the solution using the results of smaller subproblems.
By using dynamic programming, programmers can greatly improve the efficiency of their algorithms, especially for problems with overlapping subproblems. This technique is widely used in various fields such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and operations research. Understanding the principles of dynamic programming is essential for anyone looking to master advanced algorithmic concepts in Java.
