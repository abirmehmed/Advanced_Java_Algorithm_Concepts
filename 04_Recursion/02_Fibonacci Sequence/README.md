Certainly! Here's an example of a recursive function in Java to generate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence:

```java
public class Fibonacci {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        // base cases: Fibonacci of 0 is 0 and Fibonacci of 1 is 1
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;

public class Fibonacci {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        // base cases: Fibonacci of 0 is 0, Fibonacci of 1 is 1
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // recursive case: Fibonacci of n is the sum of Fibonacci of (n-1) and Fibonacci of (n-2)
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 8;
        int result = fibonacci(number);
        System.out.println("The " + number + "th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this code, the `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. It first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 0 or 1 respectively (as these are the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `n-1` and `n-2`, and returns the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers. This process continues until it reaches the base cases, at which point the recursion stops and the final Fibonacci number is returned.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `fibonacci` function by calculating the 8th number in the Fibonacci sequence and printing the result.
