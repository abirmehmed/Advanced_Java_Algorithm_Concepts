# Recursion

Recursion is a powerful concept in computer programming and is a key component of many algorithmic solutions. In simple terms, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself within its own body. This allows the function to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem.
One important thing to note about recursion is the presence of a base case, which defines the point at which the function stops calling itself and returns a result. The base case is crucial in preventing the function from executing indefinitely.

Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. For example, it is commonly used to traverse trees, compute factorials, or generate Fibonacci sequences. By utilizing recursion, programmers can write elegant and concise code to tackle complex problems. However, it is essential to pay attention to the efficiency and resource usage of recursive solutions to avoid performance issues.
