#### Explanation of the Code:

The code above demonstrates how to implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in Java to find a target element in a graph or a tree. Here's how it works:

1. The code defines a `Node` class that represents a node in the tree. Each node has a value and references to its left and right child nodes.

2. The `BreadthFirstSearch` class contains the main logic for the BFS algorithm. It has a `root` member variable that represents the root node of the tree.

3. The `BFS` method takes the target element as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the target element is found or not.

4. Inside the `BFS` method, a `Queue` is created using the `LinkedList` implementation. The `Queue` is used to keep track of the nodes to be visited.

5. The root node is added to the queue to start the BFS traversal.

6. The `while` loop continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the current node is removed from the front of the queue using the `poll` method.

7. The value of the current node is checked against the target element. If they are equal, it means the target element is found, and `true` is returned.

8. If the target element is not found, the left and right child nodes of the current node are added to the queue if they exist.

9. The process continues until the target element is found or the queue is empty. If the queue becomes empty and the target element is not found, `false` is returned.

10. In the `main` method, a sample tree is created, and a target element (5 in this case) is specified.

11. The `BFS` method is called with the target element, and the result is printed to the console.

The output of the above code will be:
```
Visited node: 1
Visited node: 2
Visited node: 3
Visited node: 4
Visited node: 5
Target element 5 found!
```

That's it! The code demonstrates how to implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in Java to find a target element in a graph or a tree.
