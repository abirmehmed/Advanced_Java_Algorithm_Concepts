Sure! Here's an example implementation of the Fibonacci search algorithm in Java:

```java
public class FibonacciSearch {
    public static int fibonacciSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        // Generate the Fibonacci series
        int fib2 = 0; // Second Fibonacci number
        int fib1 = 1; // First Fibonacci number
        int fib = fib2 + fib1; // Next Fibonacci number

        while (fib < n) {
            fib2 = fib1;
            fib1 = fib;
            fib = fib2 + fib1;
        }

        int offset = -1; // Offset to keep track of the eliminated range

        while (fib > 1) {
            int i = Math.min(offset + fib2, n - 1);

            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i; // Found target at index i
            } else if (arr[i] < target) {
                fib = fib1;
                fib1 = fib2;
                fib2 = fib - fib1;
                offset = i;
            } else {
                fib = fib2;
                fib1 = fib1 - fib2;
                fib2 = fib - fib1;
            }
        }

        if (fib1 == 1 && arr[offset + 1] == target) {
            return offset + 1; // Found target at index offset + 1
        }

        return -1; // Target not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19};
        int target = 9;

        int result = fibonacciSearch(arr, target);

        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("Element not found");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `fibonacciSearch` method takes an array `arr` and a target element `target` as input. It starts by generating the Fibonacci series until the next Fibonacci number is greater than or equal to the length of the array.

The algorithm then enters a while loop that continues as long as the current Fibonacci number `fib` is greater than 1. Inside the loop, it calculates the index `i` based on the offset and the current Fibonacci number `fib2`. If the target element is found at index `i`, the method returns the index. If the target element is less than the element at index `i`, the algorithm updates the Fibonacci numbers and the offset to search the lower portion of the array. If the target element is greater than the element at index `i`, the algorithm updates the Fibonacci numbers to search the upper portion of the array.

After the while loop, if the current Fibonacci number is 1 and the element at `offset + 1` is equal to the target, the method returns `offset + 1`. Otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target element was not found in the array.

In the `main` method, an example array is defined, and the `fibonacciSearch` method is called with a target value of 9. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that this implementation assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order.
