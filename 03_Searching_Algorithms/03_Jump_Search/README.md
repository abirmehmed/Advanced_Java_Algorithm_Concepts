Jump Search: Implement the jump search algorithm to find a target element in a sorted array by making a jump of a fixed step size.

```java
public class JumpSearch {
    public static int jumpSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int step = (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
        int prev = 0;
        
        while (arr[Math.min(step, n) - 1] < target) {
            prev = step;
            step += (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
            
            if (prev >= n) {
                return -1; // If the target element is not found, return -1
            }
        }
        
        while (arr[prev] < target) {
            prev++;
            
            if (prev == Math.min(step, n)) {
                return -1; // If the target element is not found, return -1
            }
        }
        
        if (arr[prev] == target) {
            return prev; // Return the index of the target element
        }
        
        return -1; // If the target element is not found, return -1
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30};
        int target = 20;
        
        int index = jumpSearch(arr, target);
        
        if (index != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + index);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found in the array");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code:

The code above implements the Jump Search algorithm, which is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays. Here's how it works:

1. The `jumpSearch` method takes a sorted array of integers (`arr`) and a target element (`target`) as input and returns the index of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.

2. It initializes the length of the array (`n`), the step size (`step`) as the square root of `n`, and the previous index (`prev`) as 0.

3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as the element at the minimum of `step` and `n` minus one index (`arr[Math.min(step, n) - 1]`) is less than the target element.

4. Inside the loop, it updates the `prev` index to the current `step` index and increases the `step` by the square root of `n`.

5. If the `prev` index becomes greater than or equal to `n`, it means the target element is not present in the array, so the method returns -1.

6. After exiting the first while loop, it enters a second while loop that continues as long as the element at the `prev` index is less than the target element.

7. Inside the second loop, it increments the `prev` index by 1.

8. If the `prev` index becomes equal to the minimum of `step` and `n`, it means the target element is not present in the remaining block, so the method returns -1.

9. If the element at the `prev` index is equal to the target element, it means the target element is found, so the method returns the `prev` index.

10. If none of the above conditions are satisfied, it means the target element is not present in the array, so the method returns -1.

11. In the `main` method, an example sorted array `{5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30}` is created, and the target element is set to 20.

12. The `jumpSearch` method is called with the array and target element as arguments, and the returned index is stored in the `index` variable.

13. If the returned index is not -1, it means the target element is found, so a message is printed indicating the index where the element is found. Otherwise, a message is printed indicating that the element is not found in the array.

The output of the above code will be:
```
Element found at index 3
```

That's it! The code implements the Jump Search algorithm in Java to find a target element in a sorted array by making a jump of a fixed step size.
