Sure! Here's an implementation of the search operation in a Red-Black Tree in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;
    boolean isRed;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.isRed = true;
    }
}

public class RedBlackTree {
    private Node root;

    public boolean search(int key) {
        Node current = root;

        while (current != null) {
            if (key == current.data) {
                return true;
            } else if (key < current.data) {
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                current = current.right;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    // Other methods for insertion, deletion, and balancing the tree
    // ...

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RedBlackTree tree = new RedBlackTree();

        tree.root = new Node(10);
        tree.root.left = new Node(5);
        tree.root.right = new Node(15);
        tree.root.left.left = new Node(3);
        tree.root.left.right = new Node(7);
        tree.root.right.left = new Node(12);
        tree.root.right.right = new Node(18);

        int key = 7;
        boolean found = tree.search(key);

        if (found) {
            System.out.println("Element " + key + " found in the Red-Black Tree.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element " + key + " not found in the Red-Black Tree.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `Node` class represents a node in the Red-Black Tree. Each node contains a `data` field to store the value, `left` and `right` pointers to its left and right child nodes, and a boolean `isRed` to indicate whether the node is red or black.

The `RedBlackTree` class represents the Red-Black Tree itself. It has a `root` field to store the root node of the tree.

The `search` method takes a key as input and performs a search operation in the Red-Black Tree. It starts from the root node and compares the key with the data in each node. If the key matches the data in a node, it returns `true`. If the key is less than the data, it moves to the left child of the current node. If the key is greater than the data, it moves to the right child. The search continues until the key is found or until it reaches a null node, in which case it returns `false`.

In the `main` method, an example Red-Black Tree is created with some nodes. The `search` method is then called with a key value of 7. If the key is found in the tree, it prints a message indicating that the element is found. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the element is not found.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation of the Red-Black Tree and does not include the balancing operations or other methods like insertion and deletion. The focus here is on the search operation.
