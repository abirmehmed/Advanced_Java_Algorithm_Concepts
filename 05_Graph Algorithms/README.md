# Graph Algorithms

Graph Algorithms are a crucial aspect of Advanced Java Algorithm Concepts. A graph is a collection of nodes or vertices, connected by edges. Graphs can be used to represent various real-life scenarios, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

Graph Algorithms provide efficient methods for solving problems on these graphs. Some commonly used graph algorithms include breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), which are used for traversing and searching in a graph. These algorithms help identify the shortest path between two nodes, find cycles in a graph, and detect connected components.
Another important graph algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. This algorithm is widely used in network routing and navigation systems.
