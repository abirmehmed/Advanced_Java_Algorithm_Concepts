# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are an important concept in computer science, and in particular, in the field of algorithm design. A greedy algorithm follows the problem-solving approach of making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

In the context of advanced Java algorithm concepts, greedy algorithms are often used to solve optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best possible solution. The algorithm starts with an empty solution and iteratively adds elements that are locally optimal, without considering the overall impact on the final solution.
To implement a greedy algorithm in Java, you typically start by defining the problem and identifying the criteria that make a choice locally optimal. Then, you design a loop that iteratively makes choices based on these criteria until the desired solution is achieved.

It's important to note that while greedy algorithms can often find a good solution quickly, they may not always guarantee the globally optimal solution. Therefore, it's crucial to analyze the problem and its constraints before applying a greedy algorithm.

Overall, understanding greedy algorithms is essential for advanced Java algorithm concepts, as they provide a powerful technique for solving optimization problems efficiently. By making locally optimal choices, these algorithms can often provide satisfactory solutions in a wide range of applications.

1. Activity Selection Problem: Given a set of activities with start and finish times, find the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

2. Fractional Knapsack Problem: Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting fractions of items to fit into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity.

3. Huffman Coding: Implement the Huffman coding algorithm to compress and decompress data. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to different characters, with more frequent characters having shorter codes.

4. Minimum Spanning Tree: Implement and compare the performance of different algorithms (such as Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm) to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. Analyze their time complexity and compare their performance on graphs of different sizes and structures.

5. Interval Scheduling Problem: Given a set of intervals, find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be selected.

6. Coin Change Problem: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount. This problem is often solved using a greedy approach, where you select the largest denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining target amount.

7. Job Sequencing Problem: Given a set of jobs with deadlines and profits, find the maximum profit that can be obtained by scheduling the jobs within their deadlines.

8. Subset Sum Problem: Given a set of numbers and a target sum, find a subset of numbers that adds up to the target sum. This problem can be solved using a greedy approach where you select the largest numbers that are less than or equal to the remaining target sum.

9. Dijkstra's Algorithm with Positive Edge Weights: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph with positive edge weights. Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that selects the vertex with the smallest distance from the source vertex at each step.

10. Knapsack Problem with Greedy Approach: Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items to fit into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity. In this variation, a greedy approach is used to select items based on their value-to-weight ratio.

11. Minimum Number of Platforms: Given the arrival and departure times of trains at a railway station, find the minimum number of platforms required to accommodate all the trains.

12. Job Scheduling with Deadlines and Penalties: Given a set of jobs with deadlines, durations, and penalties for missing deadlines, find the schedule that maximizes the total penalties earned.

13. Watering Plants Problem: Given a sequence of plants with their water requirements and the maximum amount of water that can be carried at a time, find the minimum number of refills required to water all the plants.

14. Interval Partitioning Problem: Given a set of intervals, find the minimum number of resources required to schedule all the intervals, where no two intervals assigned to the same resource overlap.

15. Jump Game: Given an array of non-negative integers representing the maximum jump length at each position, determine if it is possible to reach the last index starting from the first index.

16. Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes: Given an array of rope lengths, find the minimum cost to connect all the ropes into one rope. The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths.

17. Gas Station Problem: Given an array of gas stations with their gas amounts and distances between them, find the starting gas station index from which you can complete a circular trip, visiting all the gas stations.

18. Non-overlapping Intervals: Given a set of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to make the remaining intervals non-overlapping.

19. Task Scheduling Problem: Given a set of tasks with their execution times and dependencies, find the minimum time required to complete all the tasks, considering that tasks can only be executed in a certain order.

20. Smallest Subarray with Sum Greater than a Given Value: Given an array of positive integers and a target sum, find the length of the smallest subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target sum.
