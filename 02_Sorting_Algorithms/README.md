# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are an essential concept in computer science and Java programming. They provide a way to arrange a collection of data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. There are various sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

One commonly used sorting algorithm is the bubble sort. This algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues iterating through the whole list until the collection is sorted. Bubble sort is easy to understand but not suitable for large datasets as it has a time complexity of O(n^2).
Another common algorithm is the merge sort, which follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively divides the collection into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is efficient for large datasets.

Other important sorting algorithms include quicksort, selection sort, and insertion sort. Each algorithm has its own unique approach to sorting and understanding them can greatly improve your ability to write efficient Java programs.
