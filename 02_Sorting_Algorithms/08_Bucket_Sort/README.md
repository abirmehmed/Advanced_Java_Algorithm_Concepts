#### Explanation of the Code:

The code above implements the bucket sort algorithm, which is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into a number of buckets and then distributing the elements into these buckets based on their values. Here's how it works:

1. The `bucketSort` method takes an array of floating-point numbers as input and sorts it in ascending order using the bucket sort algorithm.

2. It starts by creating an array of `n` empty buckets, where `n` is the length of the input array.

3. It then iterates through each element in the input array and determines the index of the bucket it should be placed in. The index is calculated by multiplying the element value by `n` and taking the integer part.

4. After determining the index, it adds the element to the corresponding bucket.

5. Once all the elements are added to the buckets, it sorts each bucket individually using the `Collections.sort` method.

6. Finally, it concatenates the sorted buckets back into the original array, resulting in a sorted array of floating-point numbers.

7. In the `main` method, an example array `{0.42f, 0.32f, 0.33f, 0.52f, 0.37f, 0.47f, 0.51f}` is created. The `bucketSort` method is called to sort the array in ascending order.

8. Finally, the sorted array is printed using a `for-each` loop.

The output of the above code will be:
```
Sorted array:
0.32 0.33 0.37 0.42 0.47 0.51 0.52
```

That's it! The code implements the bucket sort algorithm in Java to sort an array of floating-point numbers in ascending order.
