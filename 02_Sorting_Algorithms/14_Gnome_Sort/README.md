Gnome Sort: Implement the gnome sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
#

```java
public class GnomeSort {
    public static void gnomeSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < n) {
            if (index == 0) {
                index++;
            }
            
            if (arr[index] >= arr[index - 1]) {
                index++;
            } else {
                int temp = arr[index];
                arr[index] = arr[index - 1];
                arr[index - 1] = temp;
                index--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {9, 1, 5, 3, 2};
        gnomeSort(arr);
        
        System.out.println("Sorted array:");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}

#### Explanation of the Code:

The code above implements the Gnome Sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm. Here's how it works:

1. The `gnomeSort` method takes an array of integers as input and sorts it in ascending order using the Gnome Sort algorithm.

2. It uses a while loop to iterate over the array. The loop continues until the index reaches the end of the array.

3. Inside the loop, the algorithm compares the current element (`arr[index]`) with the previous element (`arr[index - 1]`). If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, the index is incremented.

4. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, the algorithm swaps the elements and decrements the index.

5. The algorithm continues this process until the index reaches the end of the array, resulting in a sorted array.

6. Finally, the sorted array is printed using a `for-each` loop in the `main` method.

In the `main` method, an example array `{9, 1, 5, 3, 2}` is created. The `gnomeSort` method is called to sort the array in ascending order.

The output of the above code will be:
```
Sorted array:
1 2 3 5 9
```

That's it! The code implements the Gnome Sort algorithm in Java to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
