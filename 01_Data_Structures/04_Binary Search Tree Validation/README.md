#
Binary Search Tree Validation: Write a function that takes the root of a binary tree as input and determines whether it is a valid binary search tree. For a binary tree to be valid, the left subtree of a node should contain only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree should contain only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        return isValidBST(root, null, null);
    }

    private boolean isValidBST(TreeNode node, Integer min, Integer max) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if ((min != null && node.val <= min) || (max != null && node.val >= max)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return isValidBST(node.left, min, node.val) && isValidBST(node.right, node.val, max);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a binary tree
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(4);
        root.left = new TreeNode(2);
        root.right = new TreeNode(6);
        root.left.left = new TreeNode(1);
        root.left.right = new TreeNode(3);
        root.right.left = new TreeNode(5);
        root.right.right = new TreeNode(7);
        
        // Create an instance of the Solution class
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Test the isValidBST method
        boolean isValid = solution.isValidBST(root);
        
        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Is the binary tree a valid binary search tree? " + isValid);
    }
}
```

Let's go through the code and explain it step by step:

1. We start by defining a `TreeNode` class, which represents a node in the binary tree. Each node has a value (`val`) and references to its left and right children.

2. Next, we define the `Solution` class that contains the `isValidBST` method. This method takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the tree is a valid binary search tree.

3. The `isValidBST` method is a wrapper function that calls the recursive helper function `isValidBST` with an additional `min` and `max` parameter. This allows us to keep track of the valid range of values for each node.

4. The recursive helper function `isValidBST` takes a node, `min`, and `max` as input. It returns `true` if the subtree rooted at the current node is a valid binary search tree within the given range, and `false` otherwise.

5. At each node, we check if the node's value violates the binary search tree property. If the `min` is not `null` and the node's value is less than or equal to `min`, or if the `max` is not `null` and the node's value is greater than or equal to `max`, we return `false` indicating that the tree is not a valid binary search tree.

6. If the current node's value is within the valid range, we recursively call the `isValidBST` function on the left and right subtrees, updating the `min` and `max` values accordingly. For the left subtree, the `max` value is set to the current node's value, ensuring that all nodes in the left subtree are less than the current node. For the right subtree, the `min` value is set to the current node's value, ensuring that all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the current node.

7. If the recursive calls for the left and right subtrees return `true`, indicating that both subtrees are valid binary search trees, we return `true` from the current recursive call as well.

8. In the `Main` class, we create a binary tree with values `4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7` and test the `isValidBST` function using an instance of the `Solution` class.

9. Finally, we print the result of the `isValidBST` method, indicating whether the binary tree is a valid binary search tree or not.

The code uses a recursive approach to perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree, ensuring that each node's value is within the valid range. By checking the values in an in-order traversal, we can validate if the binary tree is a valid binary search tree or not based on the defined rules.

In this case, the binary tree with values `4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7` is a valid binary search tree because the left subtree of each node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value. Therefore, the output of the program will be "Is the binary tree a valid binary search tree? true".
