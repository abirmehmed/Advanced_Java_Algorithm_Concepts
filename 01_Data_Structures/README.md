# Data Structures

Data structures are an essential part of computer programming and play a crucial role in efficient data management. They are used to organize and store data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of information. The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of an application.
Some commonly used data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Arrays are a simple data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Linked lists, on the other hand, use nodes to store elements and maintain a chain-like structure. Stacks and queues are used for managing data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) or First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, respectively.

Trees provide a hierarchical structure and have applications in concepts like binary search trees, AVL trees, and heaps. Graphs are used to represent relationships between different entities and are widely used in network or social network analysis.
Understanding different data structures and their characteristics is essential for efficient algorithm design and implementation. Each data structure has its strengths and weaknesses, making it important to choose the right one based on the specific problem at hand. By mastering data structures, advanced Java programmers can optimize their algorithms and create more efficient and scalable software solutions.

Here are some Problems that we will try to solve . 

1. Reverse a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of the string. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

2. Balanced Parentheses: Write a function that takes a string of parentheses as input and determines whether the parentheses are balanced. For example, if the input is "((()))", the output should be true, but if the input is "(()))", the output should be false.

3. Palindrome Linked List: Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome. For example, if the input is 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1, the output should be true.

4. Binary Search Tree Validation: Write a function that takes the root of a binary tree as input and determines whether it is a valid binary search tree. For a binary tree to be valid, the left subtree of a node should contain only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree should contain only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

5. Implement a Stack using Linked List: Implement a stack data structure using a linked list. The stack should support push, pop, and peek operations.

6. Implement a Queue using Stack: Implement a queue data structure using two stacks. The queue should support enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.

7. Largest Rectangle in Histogram: Given an array of non-negative integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the histogram. For example, if the input is [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], the output should be 10.

8. LRU Cache: Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, which is a data structure that stores a fixed number of items and evicts the least recently used item when the cache reaches its capacity. The cache should support get and put operations.

9. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, if the input is "abcabcbb", the output should be 3 (which corresponds to the substring "abc").

10. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree: Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization is the process of converting a binary tree into a string representation, and deserialization is the reverse process. The tree can be serialized in any format of your choice.

11. Top K Frequent Elements: Given an array of integers, find the k most frequent elements. For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3] and k is 2, the output should be [1, 2].

12. Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph: Given a directed graph, determine whether it contains a cycle. For example, if the input is [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]], the output should be true, as there is a cycle in the graph.
